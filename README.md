# quadratic-equation
This is a C++ Program to Find All Roots of a Quadratic Equation.
In This program accepts coefficients of a quadratic equation from the user and displays the roots (both real and complex roots depending upon the discriminant).
For a quadratic equation ```ax2+bx+c = 0``` (where a, b and c are coefficients),its roots is given by the following formula.

* The term ```b2-4ac``` is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The discriminant tells the nature of the roots.

If discriminant is ```greater than 0```, the roots are real and different.

If discriminant is ```equal to 0```, the roots are real and equal.

If discriminant is ```less than 0```, the roots are complex and different.
